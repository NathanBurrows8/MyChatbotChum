#the original plan was to use PyKE but this only works on Python 2.x and is deprecated - as this had the most documentation/was most popular
#now the plan is to use Experta which is a fork for PyKnow (also deprecated). Can be pip installed
#Experta is a Python library based on the CLIPS programming language.
